/*
The Calendar class is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a specific instant in time and 
a set of calendar fields such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for manipulating the calendar fields, 
such as getting the date of the next week.

You are given a date. You just need to write the method, , which returns the day on that date.
To simplify your task, we have provided a portion of the code in the editor.

-- Answer : 
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
    static String getDay(String day, String month, String year) {
        int d = Integer.parseInt(day);
        int m = Integer.parseInt(month);
        int y = Integer.parseInt(year);
        return LocalDate.of(y,m,d).getDayOfWeek().toString();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String month = in.next();
        String day = in.next();
        String year = in.next();
        
        System.out.println(getDay(day, month, year));
    }
}

   }
  };
  System.setSecurityManager(securityManager);
 }
}
