"In computing, End Of File (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source." â€” (Wikipedia: End-of-file)

The challenge here is to read  lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all  lines of content.

Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

Input Format

Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

-- Answer : 
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = 0;
        String str;
        while( sc.hasNext() ) {
            str = sc.nextLine();
            i++;
            System.out.format("%d %s\n", i, str);
        }
    }
}
